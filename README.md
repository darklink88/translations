# Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to translate [Weather Line](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id715319015) app into different languages. Translations are done here on Github by app users in exchange for lifetime access to Weather Line. Contact us at team@weatherlineapp.com if you would like to contribute!

# How To

1. Login to Github (create a free account [here](github.com/join))
2. From the [directory](https://github.com/weather-line/translations), click the language file(s) you would like to translate. Each language can have multiple files.
3. Each file has different instructions, read them carefully.
4. Click the pencil icon in the top right corner to start editing.
5. To save, scroll to the very bottom, add a title and description to your changes, select the option for "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" than click "propose a file change". This has saved your own version of the file, with your edits, to your github account.

6. When you are done with all your edits and ready to submit the file for approval, open a "new pull request".
7. Change "compare:" to your file name, and click "Create pull request"!
